# TP01_WineQuality
We had to implement algorithm function.

### Score
81,50 %
Remarks:
- In the Wine class, you had to define the different parameters as attributes
- In Utils, you had to use CsvHelper for the import
- It is good to have made the code for the confusion matrix, but the code is not very clean with the succession of if.
